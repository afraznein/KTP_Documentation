1	-General Rules, Games, and Servers-

&nbsp;	

1.1	• KTP reserves the right to modify any rules as needed at any time. This includes changes due to software updates/releases and all other changes deemed necessary to the league. Changes to the rules will be posted here AND announced somewhere publicly. Best faith efforts will be made to ensure no-one misses a rule change, but teams should check the rules on a regular basis and prior to every match to ensure they are in complete compliance.

&nbsp;	

1.2	• Upon an infraction of the rules listed here or the rules listed in the KTP Community Rules any combination of: a player or multiple players may be suspended, a game may be forfeited, or a match may be forfeited.

&nbsp;	

1.3	• A 'game' consists of a single contest between two opponents on a single map. A 'match' consists of one or more 'games' between the same two teams. A 'BO3 match' would consist of up to three 'games'. Suspensions will always be detailed in an amount of time or number of 'games' instead of 'matches'.

&nbsp;	

1.4	• For any given 'game': The correct map must be played, the correct KTP config must be used, and the match must be played on a KTP approved server.

&nbsp;	

1.5	• The server must qualify as a KTP approved server which entails: a dedicated non-listening server, server logs set to record, HLTV must be present and with a minimum of a 120 seconds delay, server and hltv must have gone through configuration process (by Jrod/Nein). Final admin approval must be given before any server may be used for any KTP 'games' or 'matches'.

&nbsp;	

1.6	• In addition, servers owners must provide any HLTV passwords to KTP admins, give KTP admins server rcon, server dashboard access, and FTP access.

&nbsp;	

1.7	• In the event the server crashes in the first five minutes of a half, the half will be restarted. In the event the server crashes after the first five minutes of a half, half must be restarted and played with the same score and same amount of time remaining, rounded up to the nearest minute. Score will need to be handled manually, time remaining can be adjusted via server command. No player substitutions may be made at this time.

&nbsp;	

1.8	• The use of restricted areas on a map may result in player suspension and/or game/match forfeiture. Accessing an area via pixel walking, pixel walking and hanging in an area (such as harrington ladder), or an area that is only accessible via pixel walking is generally illegal. Please see Illegal Spots for examples of map areas that are considered illegal as well as a short video demonstrating illegal pixel walking.

&nbsp;	

1.9	• In the event of a tie, two five-minute halves of overtime should be played. These overtime rounds are to be played immediately after the match. Overtime rounds should continue until a winner can be established.The overtime configs have the normal config name with \_ot added to the end. For example: ktp\_harrington\_ot.cfg.Failure to complete overtime rounds will result in a loss for both teams.

&nbsp;	

1.10	• Spectators: No unauthorized spectators are allowed in the game server during official matches. The only spectators permitted are KTP admins or official broadcasters (e.g. the HLTV proxy with the required delay, or other league-sanctioned casters). This rule is in place to prevent any form of real-time “ghosting” or outside assistance. Unauthorized individuals joining the server to spectate may cause the game to be paused or forfeited at the admins’ discretion.

&nbsp;	

1.11	"• Team Admission and Participation Eligibility: KTP reserves the sole and absolute discretion to approve or deny entry to any team seeking to participate in the league. This authority is exercised to preserve the fairness, safety, and overall enjoyment of the competition for all participants.



• Disruptive Conduct: Behavior intended to provoke conflict, interfere with gameplay, or violate league policies such as the KTP Community Rules.



• Operational Unreliability: Patterns of forfeits, missed matches, excessive roster turnover, or any other behavior that may disrupt league scheduling or competitive consistency."

&nbsp;	

1.12	• BYEs and Forfeit Scoring: BYEs will be awarded the average point value of all teams in the same division, calculated after the completion of all matches in that division on that map. Forfeits will only be scored after the end of regulation. If a BYE is awaiting a potential forfeit and that forfeit is confirmed at the end of regulation, it will instead be treated as a BYE and scored using the average point value method described above—as if neither match had occurred for scoring purposes.

&nbsp;	

2	-Teams, Regions, Home/Away, and Ringer Rules-

&nbsp;	

2.1	• An INTERNATIONAL team is any team that has a participating majority (4 EU/SA) players in the game.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;	

2.7.1	• A single roster window will open during the season (around the half-way mark) and will be announced at least one week prior. Modifications to rosters may be ticket requested at this time. Additions to rosters for teams in the highest division will be approved pending roster space. Additions to rosters for teams not in the higest division require admin approval to preserve the league competitive integrity.

&nbsp;	

2.8	• No agreements between teams or captains will allow anyone to bypass any rules or suspensions of any kind. Ignoring rules or suspensions may result in captain suspension, player suspension, and/or team forfeiture of games/matches.

&nbsp;	

2.9	• A 'ringer' is a player not on your roster used in a match. Ringers are subject to the opposing team's approval.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;	

2.11	• Team Forfeits and Removal: Teams that repeatedly forfeit their matches may be subject to removal from the league. If a team fails to show up or forfeits more than once in a season, the admins have discretion to remove that team from the schedule to maintain competitive integrity and scheduling fairness. All participants are expected to make a good-faith effort to play their matches as scheduled.

&nbsp;	

3.7	• All disputes must be filed within 24 hours of match completion by a team captain. Teams may file two cheating disputes in the regular season and one cheating dispute in the post-season. If a disputed player is guilty of cheating, the disputing team will not be charged with a dispute.

&nbsp;	

4.3	• All players must retain all demos, screenshots and MOSS files for the length of the season.

&nbsp;	

4.6	• Players are prohibited from binding any action in conjunction with +attack. Players may not bind +attack or +duck to mwheelup or mwheeldown (or any other macroed key) to accelerate shooting weapons faster than they are intended to be or to bypass stamina restrictions. 

&nbsp;	

4.7	• Players may not script to automate player attacking, player movement, or to gain an unfair advantage. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;	

5.4	• All captains must schedule games/matches with opposing teams in a fair manner with integrity.

5.7	• For playoff BO3 matches only, failure to submit your veto to admins by 24 hours from the default start time of your match will result in admins doing your veto for you.

&nbsp;	

5.8	• Captain Accountability: Captains are expected to ensure their team members understand and follow all the rules. This means captains should remind their players to record demos, run MOSS, use the correct tags, and so on. If a team repeatedly violates rules (for example, multiple players not recording demos or using wrong SteamIDs), the captain may be held partially responsible for failing to enforce league requirements within the team. In serious cases, a captain could face suspension for negligence in managing their team. Being a captain implies leadership – make sure your team is playing fair and adhering to KTP standards.
