## Substantive Changes Identified

### 1. Rule 1.7 - Server Crash Procedure
**Type:** ADDITION

**Original:**
> In the event the server crashes in the first five minutes of a half, the half will be restarted. In the event the server crashes after the first five minutes of a half, half must be restarted and played with the same score and same amount of time remaining, rounded up to the nearest minute. Score will need to be handled manually, time remaining can be adjusted via server command. No player substitutions may be made at this time.

**New Version Adds:**
> **Mandatory notification:** Teams must inform a league admin immediately when a crash/restart occurs.

**Impact:** Players are now explicitly required to notify admins immediately upon server crash. This was not stated in the original rules.

---

### 2. Rule 3.4 - Definition of Cheating
**Type:** ADDITION

**Original:**
> Cheating includes but is not limited to: the use of any program that aids in the visual location of players on a map, recoil control, target acquisition, or illegally modifying game files.

**New Version Adds:**
> - Snap tap, rapid trigger, or any mechanical or software-based input enhancements that allow firing beyond intended game limits

**Impact:** Snap tap and rapid trigger hardware/software are now explicitly banned. This is a new prohibition not present in the original ruleset.

---

### 3. Rule 4.5 - Voice Commands and Signals
**Type:** REMOVAL

**Original:**
> The use of voice commands or hand signals in game for anything other than communication between team mates is not allowed. Excessive voice negging opponents or abusing voice commands is not allowed. **Violation of this rule must be submitted to KTP Admins in the same manner as a dispute with a POV demo and timestamps.**

**New Version:**
> Voice commands should be used for team communication only. Excessive use to taunt, annoy, or "neg" opponents is not allowed.

**Impact:** The procedure for reporting voice command violations (submit like a dispute with POV demo and timestamps) has been removed. It's unclear how violations should now be reported.

---

### 4. Rule 5.2 - Communication and Availability
**Type:** ADDITION

**Original:**
> All captains must not be banned from the KTP discord. All captains must be available to respond to messages within a reasonable time frame via discord message.

**New Version Adds:**
> - If absent, designate an acting captain and inform admins

**Impact:** Captains are now explicitly required to designate an acting captain and inform admins if they will be absent. This procedural requirement is new.

---

### 5. Rule 5.7 - Playoff Map Vetoes
**Type:** SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE

**Original:**
> For playoff BO3 matches only, failure to submit your veto to admins by **24 hours** from the default start time of your match will result in admins doing your veto for you.

**New Version:**
> Captains must submit vetoes and map picks **at least 72 hours before** default match start time.

**Impact:** The veto submission deadline has been changed from 24 hours to 72 hours before match time. This is a significant change that requires teams to submit vetoes much earlier.

---

## Clarifications and Expansions (Non-Substantive)

These changes provide additional detail or examples but do not change the rule's meaning or enforcement:

### Rule 1.7 - Server Crash (Minor Clarification)
- Added "(score 0-0)" to clarify what "restarted" means for early crashes
- Original intent was the same, now explicit

### Rule 4.7 - No Automated Scripts
**Original:** "Players may not script to automate player attacking, player movement, or to gain an unfair advantage."

**New Version Adds Examples:**
- Rapid-fire
- Auto-recoil compensation
- Automated jumping or movement patterns

**Assessment:** These are examples of what was already covered by "to gain an unfair advantage." No new prohibitions.

### Rule 4.9 - Glitches and Exploits
**New Version Adds:**
> General principle: Any exploit not part of fair, intended gameplay is illegal, even if not explicitly listed.

**Assessment:** This codifies existing intent. The original rule already implied this by saying "All of the above are considered cheating."

### Rule 5.4 - Fair Scheduling
**New Version Expands:**
- Be proactive in communication
- Offer multiple reasonable times
- Reply promptly
- Keep records of scheduling communications

**Assessment:** These elaborate on "fair manner with integrity" but don't add new requirements.

## Recommendations

1. **Rule 1.7 (Crash Notification):** Confirm if the mandatory admin notification was intentional or if it should match original wording.

2. **Rule 3.4 (Snap Tap/Rapid Trigger):** Confirm this addition is intentional. This is a new prohibition.

3. **Rule 4.5 (Voice Command Reporting):** The removal of the reporting procedure may cause confusion. Consider adding back or clarifying how violations should be reported.

4. **Rule 5.7 (Veto Deadline):** The change from 24 to 72 hours is significant. Confirm this is the intended deadline.
